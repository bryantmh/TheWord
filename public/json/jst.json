				":27" : "Then answered all the people and said, His blood come upon us and our children.",
				":28" : "Then released he Barabbas unto them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.",

				":64" : "Now the next day that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.",
				":65" : "Command, therefore, that the sepulcher be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead; so this last imposture will be worse than the first.",
				":66" : "Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch; go your way; make it as sure as you can.",
